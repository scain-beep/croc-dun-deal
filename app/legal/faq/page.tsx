        Frequently Asked Questions
      </h1>

      {/* --- Guaranteed Approvals --- */}
      <h3>Do you provide guaranteed approvals?</h3>
      <p>
        No — no dealership or lender can legally guarantee an approval. What we *can*
        guarantee is that your application is reviewed properly, matched with the right
        lenders, and presented in a way that gives you the strongest chance based on
        your full credit history.
      </p>

      {/* --- Credit Checks --- */}
      <h3>Does applying affect my credit?</h3>
      <p>
        Any time someone checks your credit, it can affect your score. The key is making
        sure your information is only sent to lenders who make sense for your situation.
        That’s my job — to minimize unnecessary inquiries and protect your score while
        still finding real approval options.
      </p>

      {/* --- Rebuilding Credit --- */}
      <h3>Can I apply if I’m rebuilding my credit?</h3>
      <p>
        Absolutely. Your credit is more than a score — lenders look at the whole
        picture. We work with lenders who understand credit challenges, and our goal is
        to find an approval that fits your budget. Even if we can’t place you in a
        vehicle right away, we’ll map out a realistic path to rebuild your credit over
        the next 12–24 months.
      </p>

      {/* --- Info Sharing --- */}
      <h3>Do you sell or share my information?</h3>
      <p>
        No. Your information is never sold. It is only shared with the specific lenders
        required to process your application, and only when you’re ready for us to do
        so.
      </p>

      {/* --- Application Time --- */}
      <h3>How long does the process take?</h3>
      <p>
        Simple applications can be reviewed the same day. More detailed files or
        complicated credit histories may take up to three business days as lenders ask
        for documents or clarification. We keep you updated the whole way so there are
        no surprises.
      </p>

      {/* --- Vehicle Options --- */}
      <h3>Will I get approved for the exact vehicle I want?</h3>
      <p>
        We always try. Sometimes lenders need us to work within certain guidelines
        (price, year, mileage, or payment range). Our goal is to secure a preapproval
        first, then match you with vehicles that fit the lender’s framework while still
        meeting your needs.
      </p>

      {/* --- Meeting Options --- */}
      <h3>Do I need to come into the dealership?</h3>
      <p>
        Not unless you want to. You can meet me in person in Kamloops, or we can handle
        everything over the phone — whatever is easier for you.
